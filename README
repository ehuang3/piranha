Piranha

PROGRAMS
========
* pirfilt -- collect state messges from all drivers and combine into one message
* pirctrl -- a motion libary of sorts

SCRIPTS
=======
* scripts/piranha -- Start robot drivers
* scripts/piranha-console -- Start joystick daemon and relay messages
* scripts/piranha-console -- Relate state and control messages

Force/Torque Sensors
====================
* Uses nonstandard protocol (see ATI's docs)
* Default NODE id is 0x20, conflicts with PDOs for low-numbered CANopen
  nodes
* Workaround: set node id to 0x27, so we only conflict with CANopen
  nodes > 0x70

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Are you sure it's plugged in?

SDHs
----
SDHs have an RS232 configuration shell.  To access, connect via a
serial terminal, e.g., `screen /dev/ttyS2 115200` and power cycle the
hand.  You should get a prompt to press spacebar to enter
configuration.  The configuration shell can be used to set
communication parameters, i.e, RS232 or CAN and bitrates.

Note that the DSAs and SDHs share a serial port.

NTCAN_CONTR_ERR_PASSIVE
-----------------------
This code usually means one or more of the following:
* The CAN cable is unplugged
* A device on the bus is operating at the wrong bitrate
* The CAN bus is not terminated

LWA4s
-----
These arms often lose their encoder offsets.  The script `home.sh` in
the socanmatic package can be used to reset the home offset to the
current position.
